Content owners such as media companies and ecommerce vendors pay CDN operators to pay their content to their end users. ● We can add React into our project by injecting CDN links in it (in an .html file).

In the &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; ? ● The reason it was recommended to put &lt;script&gt; tags at the end of the &lt;body&gt; was so that the scripts wouldn’t stop the browser from parsing the HTML. ● When a browser gets to a &lt;script&gt; tag, it stops everything else and loads the files for that &lt;script&gt; tag and then evaluates it. ● Thus, if you put &lt;script&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; or at the beginning of the &lt;body&gt;, then the user would have to wait longer for the HTML to render, possibly leaving them staring at a blank page for a while. ● Nowadays this isn’t really a concern any more because you can force the browser to download/evaluate JS files asynchronously by using the async/defer attribute on the &lt;script&gt; tag. ● Be advised, these attributes only work for &lt;script&gt; tags loading external JS files (i.e. the src attribute is pointing to a file).

What is Emmet ? ● Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into a full piece of code. What is the difference between a framework and a library ? 1. Library a. A library provides a set of helper functions/objects/modules which your application code calls for specific functionality.

Libraries typically focus on a narrow scope (e.g., strings, IO, sockets), so their APIs also tend to be smaller and require fewer dependencies. 2. Framework a. Framework on the other hand has defined open or unimplemented functions or objects which the user writes to create custom applications. b. Because a framework is itself an application. It has a wider scope and includes almost everything necessary to make a user application as per his own needs. ● When you use a library, you are in control of the flow of the application. ● When you use a framework, the framework is in control of the flow of the application. ● The framework dictates the architecture and how the application is structured, and you fill in the details within that structure. ● For example, a web framework will often handle routing, middleware and request processing and you define the specific actions for your application within that structure. ● In a library, you decide when and where to call library functions. ● For example, you might use a library to perform specific tasks like handling HTTP requests, manipulating data, or creating UI components. Why is React named “React” ? ● React is abruptly named because it “reacts” quickly to the changes without reloading the whole page. ● It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage.

What is the difference between React and React-dom ? ● React is a JavaScript library, designed for building better user interfaces. ● React-dom is a complementary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM. ● While React provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, React-dom handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment. Explain the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. 1. Real DOM a. Real DOM is the actual structure of the webpage. b. React updates complete document in the Real DOM. c. Real DOM is the actual web page rendered on the browser. Any changes made reflect directly on the complete webpage. 2. Virtual DOM a. Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of the Real DOM. b. React updates the state changes in virtual DOM first and then it syncs with the Real DOM. c. Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, we can make changes in the blueprint but those will not directly apply to the machine. d. Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of UI is kept in memory synced with Real DOM by a library such as React-dom and this process is called reconciliation .

Virtual DOM makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time but the reason is the amount of changed information - rather than wasting time on updating the entire page. When does React sync the changes of Virtual DOM with Real DOM ? ● React synchronizes the changes from the virtual DOM to the Real DOM during a process called reconciliation. This process involves several steps: ○ State and prop changes ○ Re-rendering ○ Diffing - React compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one to identify what has changed. ○ Batch updates - React doesn’t immediately update the Real DOM with each change. Instead, it batches updates to optimize performance. The batching happens within the lifecycle of an event or after a certain period of time. (e.g., after user action like clicking a button or typing in an input field). ○ Commit phase. ○ Asynchronous updates. What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js via CDN ? ● Use react.development.js during developing and debugging your application. It helps catch issues early by providing detailed error messages and warnings.

It ensures better performance, faster load times by stripping out unnecessary development features. Difference between async and defer ● Async ○ Execution order - Scripts with async attributes are executed as soon as they are downloaded regardless of the order in which they appear on the document. ○ Loading behavior - The browser will download the script in the background while continuing to parse the HTML document. Once the script is downloaded, it will immediately execute, potentially interrupting the parsing of the document. ○ Use case - Best for scripts that are independent and do not rely on the DOM being fully parsed or other scripts being loaded. ● Defer ○ Execution order - Scripts with defer attribute are executed in the order they appear in the document, but only after the entire HTML document has been parsed. ○ Loading behavior - The browser will download the scripts in the background while parsing the HTML document, but will defer execution of the script until after the HTML parsing is complete. ○ Use case - Ideal for scripts that need to interact with fully parsed DOM or that depend on other scripts.

Dev dependencies 2. Normal dependencies Caret and Tilde in package.json 1. Tilde (~) Notation a. The Tilde (~) notation is employed to match the latest patch version while freezing the major and minor versions. b. This notation is useful for automatically updating the bug fixes, considering that patch updates primarily update bugs. 2. Caret (^) Notation a. It automatically updates both minor and patch updates. b. This is used as default notation by npm. c. If the current version of a package is ^1.2.4, and tomorrow if there is an upgrade in the package and we get a new version i.e. 1.2.5, then (^) will automatically upgrade 1.2.4 to 1.2.5. d. Caret helps in upgrading the minor versions whereas tilde helps in upgrading the major versions. What is the role of the package-lock.json file ? ● The package-lock.json file in npm simply serves as a lockfile that captures the exact versions of packages and their dependencies. ● It ensures that the same version of packages is used across different installations or environments. ● This consistency prevents unexpected package versions and helps avoid compatibility issues.

Transitive Dependencies ● When a dependency has its own dependencies and those dependencies have their own dependencies, then it is known as transitive dependencies. ● In the React project, inside node modules, every dependency folder has its own package.json file which contains the dependencies and the description of that dependency. Why should we not push the node_modules to git or production ? ● Node modules are huge in size. ● If we have package.json and package-lock.json, then we can recreate the node modules anytime. ● This is why it is not recommended to push the node modules.

Key differences between npm and npx ● Installations vs Execution ● Global installs ● Temporary use ● Ease of use Why should CDN links not be used to bring React and React-dom in the project ? ● If we use CDN links, then we will have to make a network call to bring React into our project. ● Currently we use React version 18 which is mentioned in the CDN link as well. So if in future, React version 19 comes, then we will have to change the CDN links again. ● We can install React using npm install react which will store React into node modules and will not cause any dependency issues. ● To get React from a CDN link, you will need to have a network (internet) connection. Browser scripts cannot have imports/exports ● When we install React into the application and remove the CDN links, then we will get an error which says Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined . ● This happens because we have installed React, but not imported it into our JavaScript file.

So in that case, this ‘main’ key is of no use. ● When we try to execute ‘npx parcel build index.html’, then it gives an error. Because, the entry point given in the command has a conflict with the value of ‘main’ key. ● So in that case, we should remove the ‘main’ key-value pair from package.json. Executing npx parcel index.html or npx parcel build index.html ● When we execute npx parcel index.html , parcel creates a development build and stores it in the folder named dist . ● After every subsequent change, parcel will update this dist folder every time an app/component renders or every time we save new changes. ● The same thing happens when we execute npx parcel build index.html . The only difference is parcel creates a production build and stores it in the dist folder in this case. ● Note - Do not push the folders dist and .parcel-cache into git repo because they can be regenerated. Make our app compatible with older browsers/specific browsers ● To make our app compatible with older/specific browsers, we can make use of browserslist . ● In the package.json file, we can create a list and give it name as browserslist and specify all the browsers/specific versions in the list.

React Hooks ● React hook is a normal JavaScript function which is provided by React which has some logic written behind it (superpowers). ● These functions are written by facebook developers inside React. ○ useState() ■ When we call a useState() hook/function, it gives us a state variable/returns a state variable inside an array. ■ E.g., const [list, setList] = useState([]); ■ The second variable is used to modify the state variable. ■ Whenever a state variable changes/updates, React re-renders the component.

How can we change the state variable even if it is defined as a constant ? ● Consider we have a button element on clicking of which the state variable changes. ● A state variable always has an initial value. ● Whenever a state variable updates, React triggers a Reconciliation cycle i.e. React re-renders the component. ● And when the component re-renders, the state variable will have the updated value as its default value. Why do we need a useEffect() hook ? ● The useEffect() is used to handle the side effects such as fetching data and updating the DOM. ● This hook runs on every render but there is also a way of using a dependency array using which we can control the effect of rendering. ● It is used to mimic the lifecycle methods of class-based components. ● The motivation behind the introduction of useEffect is to eliminate the side effects of using class-based components.

What is optional chaining ? ● It is a feature that simplifies the process of accessing properties and methods of nested objects or arrays when intermediate properties may be null or undefined. What is the difference between a JS expression and a JS statement ? ● Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression. ● A statement is an instruction to perform a specific action. ● Such actions include creating a variable or a function, looping through an array of elements, etc. ● JavaScript programs are actually a sequence of statements.

Loading a functional component means we are invoking/mounting that function. Loading a class-based component means we are creating an instance of the class.

CreateHashRouter ● CreateHashRouter is part of the React Router library and provides routing capabilities for single-page applications. ● It’s commonly used for building client-side navigation with applications. ● Unlike traditional server side routing, it uses the fragment identifier (hash) in the URL to manage/handle routes on the client side. ● This means that changes in the URL after the # symbol do not trigger a full page reload, making it suitable for single page applications. CreateMemoryRouter ● CreateMemoryRouter is another routing component provided by React router. ● Unlike CreateHashRouter or BrowserRouter, CreateMemoryRouter is not associated with the browser’s URL. ● Instead it allows you to create an in-memory router for testing other scenarios where you don’t want to interact with the actual browser’s URL.

Return value expectation ■ The primary purpose of the useEffect callback function is to handle side effects and perform cleanup. ■ React expects us to return either nothing i.e. undefined from the callback or return a cleanup function. ■ An async function returns a promise, and it doesn’t fit well with this expected behavior. b. Execution order and timing ■ With async functions, we might not have fine-grained control over the execution order of the asynchronous code and cleanup code. ■ React relies on the returned cleanup function to handle cleanup when the component is unmounted or when the dependencies specified in the useEffect dependency array change.

Code Reusability: Custom hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic across different components without duplicating code.

When we are building a large-scaled application, it is important to break it down into different components (Bundles). Having a single bundle will make our app slower since a single bundle will contain all the code of the application which takes a lot of time to load. The solution for this is to split our app into smaller chunks (bundles). This process is known as below terms: 1. Chunking 2. Code Splitting 3. Dynamic Bundling 4. Lazy Loading 5. On demand loading For example, if we are developing an e-commerce application. This ecommerce app will have a cart which will contain different functionalities. So we can create a separate bundle for the Cart component.

It will be loaded only when the user visits the cart page. That means, with this approach the app will have 2 bundles. One would be a normal bundle which contains all the code of the app except for the cart component. This bundle will be loaded when the user visits our app. The other bundle will contain the code of the cart component which will be loaded only when the user visits the shopping cart. That is why this process is also known as on demand loading . When and why do we need lazy() ? ● In simpler terms, lazy loading is a design pattern. ● It allows you to load parts of your application on demand to reduce the initial load time. ● For example, you can initially load the components and modules related to user login and registration. Then you can load the rest of the components based on user navigation. ● You might not feel much difference when using lazy loading for small-scaled applications. But it significantly impacts large scaled applications by reducing the initial load time. ● Ultimately it improves both the use experience and application performance.

Reduces the initial load time by reducing the bundle size. 2. Reduces browser workload. 3. Improves application performance in low-band width situations. 4. Improves user experience at initial loading. 5. Optimizes resource usage. Disadvantages of lazy loading 1. Not suitable for small scale applications. 2. Placeholder can slow down quick scrolling. 3. Requires additional communication with the server to fetch resources. 4. Can affect SEO and ranking. Example ● When we use lazy() on a component which fetches the API response, React can give us an error i.e. A component suspended while responding to synchronous input . ● To avoid or handle this error, React offers a component i.e. Suspense.

When and why do we need Suspense ? ● Suspense is best used when you want to display a fallback while waiting for something to load. ● The two main use cases for this are when you are waiting for data to be fetched from an API after the initial page load and when you are lazy loading other React components.

Content: This key specifies the paths to all of your template files in your project. Tailwind CSS will scan these files for class names and generate only the necessary styles. This helps keep the final CSS file small and optimized. 2. Theme: This key is used to customize the default theme of Tailwind CSS. You can define your own values for colors, fonts, spacing, and more. 3. Extend: This key is used inside the theme key to extend the default theme without completely overriding it. This is useful for adding additional utilities or modifying existing ones. 4. Plugins: This key allows you to add plugins to Tailwind CSS. Plugins can add additional utilities, components, or modify the existing ones. Tailwind CSS has a variety of official plugins, or you can create your own. Why do we have a .postcssrc file ? The .postcssrc file (or postcss.config.js file in some setups) is used to configure PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. PostCSS is often used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS to enable additional CSS processing capabilities.

The .postcssrc file specifies which plugins to use and their configurations. 2. Tailwind CSS Integration: Tailwind CSS is a PostCSS plugin. The .postcssrc file ensures that Tailwind CSS is processed correctly during the build process. 3. Autoprefixing: Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring compatibility with different browsers. Including it in your .postcssrc file helps maintain cross-browser compatibility. 4. CSS Minification and Optimization: You can use plugins like cssnano for minifying and optimizing your CSS. This is particularly useful for production builds to reduce the file size. 5. Modularity and Maintainability: Having a dedicated configuration file for PostCSS allows for better modularity and maintainability. It separates PostCSS-related configurations from other parts of your build setup, making it easier to manage and update.

Then the value of the showHeading state variable will be changed.

What is React Context ? ● React context is a method to pass props from parent to child components, by storing the props in a store (similar in redux) and using these props from the store by child components without actually passing them manually at each level of the component tree. ● Using Redux to interact with states from parent to child components is not only quite difficult to understand but also gives you more complex code. ● Through the usage of context, the understanding of concept and code is far easier than that of Redux. ● Whenever you want a store to keep your states or variables in and use them elsewhere in your program, use Context . ● Generally when we have two or more levels (height) in our component tree, it is viable to use a store instead of passing props and then lifting the state as this will create confusion and unnecessary lengthy code.

When we build large-scale applications where we have to manage the state of a lot of components and the application has a number of features, then using Redux in our application makes sense. In small-scale or mid-scale applications, we can still manage the state without using Redux. Redux and React both are not the same thing. Redux is not part of React. They both are different libraries. All the applications built using Redux can also be built without using it. Redux is not the only library for state management. There is also another library named Zustand . Just like we have React Dev Tools, we also have Redux Dev Tools which help us to debug our application when we use Redux. There are 2 libraries that Redux team offers: 1. react-redux: This is like a bridge between React and Redux. 2. Redux toolkit: This is a newer way of writing redux. This package is intended to be the standard way of writing Redux logic. Redux Store is like a very big JavaScript object, which has a lot of data in it, stored in a global central space. Is it a good idea to store all the data in one place ? Yes Aditya Kharadkar https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand"></li><li class="carousel-slide" data-ssplayer-slide-index="79" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="width: 555px; height: 718px;"><img class="carousel-lazy-element carousel-slide-is-portrait" data-src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D1FAQEuXHAYQ0J0bA/feedshare-document-images_1280/feedshare-document-images_1280/80/1721721110308?e=1734566400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=hdbzc5kbkQUyw9EL2li08uxtMgbHKoGs8HsEhVvBrFQ" alt="80 Since the Redux store contains a lot of data, we do not want it to become very big, so we make use of Slices offered by Redux. We can assume slice as a small portion of Redux store. We can create multiple slices in our store. To keep data separate, we create logical partitions in our store. These partitions are known as Slices . If we want to keep the data related to the cart, then we will create a separate slice for the cart. If we want to keep the data related to the logged in user, then we will create a separate slice for that as well. Redux says that we cannot directly modify the data in the slice. Redux offers a way to do that. Assume that we have a cartSlice which keeps track of the data in the cart. We have an Add to cart button which adds the item into the cart. By clicking on this button, we cannot directly modify our cartSlice. To modify the cartSlice, when the user clicks on the Add To Cart button, we have to dispatch an action . When we dispatch an action, it calls a function and then this function modifies the cart . Here is the flow: User clicks the button —&gt; Dispatch an action —&gt; Action calls a function —&gt; Function modifies the cart slice The function which is being called by the action is known as Reducer Function . Aditya Kharadkar"></li><li class="carousel-slide" data-ssplayer-slide-index="80" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" style="width: 555px; height: 718px;"><img class="carousel-lazy-element carousel-slide-is-portrait" data-src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D1FAQEuXHAYQ0J0bA/feedshare-document-images_1280/feedshare-document-images_1280/81/1721721110308?e=1734566400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=teg9pn83DcGE5adfHEgTCkDRrONccRhAjJhbFwYPTEQ" alt="81 So when the user clicks the button, it dispatches an action. This action calls the reducer function and this reducer function updates the slice. ********This was about writing the data into the store.********** How to read data from the store ? Suppose I want to show the count of items in the cart on my navigation bar. We can read the data from the store by something known as Selectors . When we use a selector to read the data, this phenomenon is known as Subscribing to the store . So we can say that the navigation bar is subscribed to our store. That means the navigation bar will alway be in sync with the store. If the data in the store (cart slice in this case) changes, then the data shown on the navigation bar will also change.

This syntax assigns the handleAddItem function directly to the onClick event. b. When the button is clicked, the handleAddItem function will be called without any arguments. 2. onClick={() =&gt; handleAddItem(item)} a. This syntax uses an arrow function to call handleAddItem with the item argument. b. This is useful when you need to pass specific arguments to the handleAddItem function when the button is clicked. c. Here, the item needs to be defined or in scope when the button is rendered. d. If item is a variable available in the component’s context, it will be passed to handleAddItem when the button is clicked. 3. onClick={handleAddItem(item)} a.

To properly call handleAddItem with an argument when the button is clicked, you should wrap it in an anonymous function, like in the second example. In older redux (vanilla redux), it was not allowed to mutate the state. We used to create a copy of our state and then modify that. We also had to return the new state. This whole process is still done by Redux behind the scenes but now it is not asking developers to do it. Redux is using the immer library to do it. In the new redux, we have to mutate the state. And it is not mandatory to return the state as well.

Would you like to use TypeScript for the configuration file? -&gt; no (in this case) 2. Choose the test environment that will be used for testing -&gt; jsdom (browser-like) a. JSDOM is a library which parses and interacts with assembled HTML just like a browser. b. When we run test cases, we do not run them on the browser. But we need a browser-like environment to run them. c. JSDOM helps us to get a browser-like environment. It will give us the features of a browser. 3. Do you want to add coverage reports? -&gt; Yes 4. Which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage? -&gt; Babel 5.

Testing React Component We will test if the component is rendered on not. To test this, we first have to render the component on JSDOM . We will test if &lt;Home /&gt; component is rendered or not.

Whatever is rendered on the JSDOM can be accessed using the screen object. ● Inside the test function, we first rendered the component. ● Then we know that &lt;Home /&gt; component has an &lt;h1&gt; element. So we can say that if we find the heading (&lt;h1&gt;) element rendered on the JSDOM, that means the component is rendered. ● So to access the heading, we use the screen object. Then this screen object has a method getByRole() which can be used to find an element by its role. ● In this case we have specified the role as heading because we are finding an &lt;h1&gt; element. This found element will be stored in the constant variable heading . ● Then we use the expect() function to expect our heading to be present in the document. This can be done using the toBeInTheDocument() method which tells us if the element exists in the document or not.

These React elements are the input elements we have in our document. ● Then we want to make sure that there should be 2 input elements. Hence we expect the length of inputName to be 2.

So we have to create a mock function the same way we created the mock data. Note: A test case does not make an actual API call. Because we do not run it on the browser, so it does not have power to talk to the world. ● The actual fetch() function returns a promise which is json which then return another promise which is our actual data returned from the API call. ● So we will have to create the mock function the same way the actual fetch() function works.

This gives us the JSON which also returns a promise. ● So we assigned a function to json which returns a promise which also resolves to the actual data of the API. ● Note: This data will be the mock data we create in the mock folder . So instead of passing “data” , import the mock data and pass it here. Note: Currently, we have to run the npm run test command again and again after creating test cases.

Note: In strict mode, React renders the component twice to make sure that it renders properly. This happens only in the development mode. In production, it will render the component only once. ● Consider that we have a toggle button which handles the dark mode of the application. The value of the mode is saved in a state variable. Whenever the button is clicked, this state variable will change. ● This causes re-rendering of the component every time the button is clicked. ● Suppose we have a calculation in the same component which is not related to the dark mode feature. But whenever the button is clicked, the calculation is performed again. ● If the calculation is a heavy operation, then it will cause the performance issues.

The useMemo hook memoize the calculation result. ● useMemo() hook takes 2 arguments: ○ A callback function ○ A dependency array ● Callback function performs the calculation. ● And useMemo hook performs the operation only when there is a change in the dependency array. ● So even if all the state variables are changed in the component, but there is not change in the dependency array, then the calculation will not be performed again. useCallback ● useCallback is a React hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders . ● useCallback us quite similar to useMemo. In useMemo, we cache the result returned by a function but in useCallback, we cache the function itself. ● useCallback alse gets executed only when there is a change in the dependency array. useRef ● useRef is a React hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering . ● When there is a case, where you want to keep some data in your component which you do not want to re-render , then we use the useRef hook.
